**RStudio Tip**: There are two convenient ways to create a new app in RStudio:

-   Create a new directory and an `app.R` file containing a basic app in one step by clicking **File \| New Project**, then selecting **New Directory** and **Shiny Web Application**.

-   If you've already created the `app.R` file, you can quickly add the app boilerplate by typing "shinyapp" and pressing Shift+Tab.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
dplyr::glimpse(beaver1)
```

This should align with any background code block outside of a box

```{r collapse=TRUE}
dplyr::glimpse(beaver1)
```
